Hello, welcome to my personal page! Here you can find all about what I do. This means my CV, my portfolio of projects, but also blog posts and opinion articles I post about the different chapters of my life.

I am currently a master student of Data Science at ETH Zürich, and I also live in the Zürich area in Switzerland. I am super curious about where AI will take our society, so I am trying to follow both the technological developments as well as their commercialization and impact.
