Hello everyone,

today is Monday, I was enjoying the weekend, so had no time to write a blog. Sidenote: last two weeks I was working on my 'Bookshelf' and 'Projects' folder, rather than this blog. Sorry for this ;)

What? Michal enjoying the weekend? Yeah, so it happens, I am slowed down a bit this semester, and even though it is exam season I am trying not be completely die and have a life in between a little bit. Strange, also getting used to it. At the same time I am kinda worried that I have underestimated the exam, so the last few days will be intense that is for sure.

The story that I wanted to tell today comes from Saturday. My lovely friend Max and I we were practicing our Swiss German together. It is our shared hobby, and as neither of us is Swiss we at least have the courage to speak with one another, and that is good. I try my best to consume as much content as possible, but poor Max, poor Max, he only learns from me. And we were in a supermarket, and a friend of mine (who is Swiss) heard Max talking in Swiss German. And he thought: "That sounds like Michal." That is weird. So he went to investigate and indeed, not too far he also found me!

I laugh my ass off telling this story. The thing is, I also picked up my accent from Loris Zimmerli, a swiss influencer. And he (on purpuse) speaks in a very funny accent, so that he can entertain people. So that is how Michal German, oder Michaldeutsch came to be. Learn it, it is very funny!

Have a nice day! Keep doing what you are doing, you do it great!

Michal
