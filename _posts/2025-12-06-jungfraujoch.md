Sunday it is again!

It is also the time of the year now: Christmas are just around the corner! This means the semester is ending, I have to plan my travels home and try get some gifts for the my dear ones. Fitting this all together with all deadlines and social events seems to be impossible. My now it seems like I have succesfully mastered the craft of constantly losing my mind in situations like this, I take a deep breath, ask the good lord for some peace in my soul and go on. Today I thought I would not let my thoughts drown me and I would still go and write my blog.

I have a nice thing to share, this semester I have taken the Applied Glaciology course, where I learned a lot about how glaciers do what they do. They actually do quite a lot of things, on top of the mountain the temperatures are low so the precipitation solidifies into new ice. At the bottom of the glacier the temperatures are usually high, this means that the glacier is melting. The most interesting thing in my opinion happens in between, the glacier is moving! Ice is not fixed, through the pressure created by itself pushing from the top it moves down the mountain! I recommend watching videos like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWGR6FxFlt8) to get the feelings of what is happening.

As a part of this course, we have gone up to Jungfraujoch for an excursion. On the way there, we have seen a small avalanche from a glacier that has torn off!

On the top we have enjoyed the views, and relaxed for a bit!

And we fed the birds that go all the way up there, just to be fed by the tourists.

It was quite impressive to be up in 3500+ meters. It is actually quite tough to be up there. Especially climbing stairs is tough, as there is so little oxygen.

So yeah, that was a little trip to break a bit out of the ordinary.

Have a great week!

PS: I set up Google Analytics now, so I can see once again stats about who is reading this :3
