But wait Michal, you have not written any blogs the last two weeks! Yes, that is true, but let me defent myself a bit, cause times are changing. I have to say I let myself slip a bit, cause on Friday the 6th of February I have had (what might just as well be) the last exam of my life! And what an exam it was :) The Deep Learning exam of this year has taken us all on a trip to the unbelieable and the unreal, by giving us content which is absolutely NOT representing in the material. I have been sitting there for 2 hours, absolutely STUNNED by the exercises. The mental terror was real, however, nothing is in the end as bad as it seems, and the examiners shifted the grades up to save our poor souls. This damage will always be remembered, and I guess this serves as a reminder NOT TO come back to academic institutions for a while…</p> <p>Which is what I will be doing for the upcoming half a year. Before I get to what I will be doing, I want to note that I have taken a break to go skiing with my friends through our study association. We spend a week in Morgins in the French-speaking Swiss Wallis. I would like to thank a lot to the organizers for an amazing trip! They have been preparing food for us and organizing everything! It was amazing, nice to feel like this once in a while, not making vacation time any more stressful than it already is :) Either way, I came back broken and sick from the trip, and I am still recovering. This annoys me so much, cause it feels like the one time I actually took vacation everything went wrong :( I am often incentivized by people around me that I should be “having more fun” and that should learn to enjoy life more. Hey, I have tried, didn’t work. Have to keep trying, I guess.</p> <p>Anyway, part of why I am so pissed about this is that I came back sick which made me miss first day of my internship at <a href="https://tufalabs.ai/">Tufalabs</a>. This is what I was super excited about for the last few months. I have always dreamed of doing cool AI research, and now I have finally an opportunity to do it. Well, starting sick was not optimal, but I hope to catch up and work even harder in the upcoming months to make the most out of this opportunity. My internship there will be running for the whole semester, till mid august. During this, I hope to stay on top of everything in and around ARC AGI v3, an interesting benchmark for machine intelligence. We will see afterwards where this will lead me.</p> <p>Anyways, a lot happening, but somehow also not much (as per me not having energy to execute anything), I hope to come back on my feet fully soon and report to you all my findings!</p> <p>Best wishes to everybody, I love you all!</p> <p>Michal Tesnar</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="weekly-blog"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How I once gone skiing, great results.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dream Sold to the Most Ambitious: My Take on the YC Visit to ETH</title><link href="https://michaltesnar.github.io/blog/2026/yc-observations/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dream Sold to the Most Ambitious: My Take on the YC Visit to ETH"/><published>2026-01-31T14:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2026-01-31T14:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://michaltesnar.github.io/blog/2026/yc-observations</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://michaltesnar.github.io/blog/2026/yc-observations/"><![CDATA[<p>I like to say ETH is “close” to some interesting places in the world. Why? Talent from ETH is wanted; therefore, institutions and companies go a long way to visit ETH and make themselves known there. This is certainly one of the biggest perks of being a student here. Last Friday (30.01.2026), we had a visit from Y Combinator (YC)—the most famous startup accelerator, with a name derived from fixed-point combinators in lambda calculus. Three startup founders—Tom Blomfield, Grey Baker, and Chris Golda, who also later started working at YC to help other startups—came to give a talk.</p> <p>During the talk, the three shared their personal stories of how they did not like their office jobs and instead tried to create something they thought had more impact. There were a couple of points they aimed at us that I think are interesting to discuss. I will first present what was presented to us, and then share a few of my own takes.</p> <p><em>(Although I have my final presentation for my project tomorrow and an exam coming up, I decided to take a deep breath, try not to let that swallow me, and write this blog. These might be famous last words, but oh well, here we go.)</em></p> <h2 id="1-a-rapidly-changing-world">1. A Rapidly Changing World</h2> <p>There is a revolution happening, and some say it is bigger than the internet revolution. One might not see it in the GDP yet, but it is a revolution of how we interact with the world and how we think of ourselves. Large Language Models (LLMs) are getting more and more powerful, creating new opportunities for the automation of information processing. It might be that soon, all jobs will not exist the way we know them (that does not mean they will disappear, but they might just change fundamentally).</p> <p>This creates a tremendous opportunity for those who want to build a new, unique business because new gaps in demand are emerging, and one can look for them. It is also true that no one knows (yet) what the rules of business and society are in this new era; therefore, there is no playbook to follow on how to succeed. The only way forward is to try, and the way to try is to build a startup.</p> <h2 id="2-you-are-good-enough">2. You Are Good Enough!</h2> <p>The smartest minds often do not go to business school. (To be fair, the talk was aimed at technical students, so I get why this was included—not necessarily my personal opinion.) The brightest minds usually go to math and sciences—the people who can solve the most difficult questions. Therefore, running a business is not that difficult by comparison. Starting a company that does something that has already been done before is doable. Starting a company that does what nobody else has ever done is the real challenge. If you want a real challenge, you should start a startup.</p> <p>And by the way, you are good enough for it. If you are at a top technical university, the odds are you are smart enough to keep landing well-paying jobs for the rest of your life. This means you do not need to look for more credentials (more degrees, more internships) to prove you are “good”; you are already good enough to do whatever you want.</p> <h2 id="3-venture-capital-mathematics">3. Venture Capital Mathematics</h2> <p>Most startups fail. Let’s face facts. But that is okay. Venture Capital (VC) does not worry about that; all they worry about is the return on investment. Most of the money YC has made comes exclusively from a handful of companies that have billion-dollar valuations. It is like rolling a die, but the outcomes are distributed with a very heavy tail. VCs will keep betting even though they know they will not roll high numbers often, because they know when they do, it pays off.</p> <h1 id="my-reflections">My Reflections</h1> <h3 id="y-combinator-fanaticism">Y Combinator Fanaticism</h3> <p>Most startups will not succeed, but YC is still willing to fund them. That creates an interesting dynamic. Honestly, I think what most young people like about startups is that it gives them hope. There is somebody who believes in them and is willing to pay their bills, even if they fail. This is truly inspiring. Because even though most people have family and friends who support them, they mostly support them in things that are likely to succeed (e.g., getting a diploma). This faith in the possibility of success is contagious in the community, and that is amazing.</p> <p>The thing I dislike is the survivor bias. All the founders talk as if what they did was the definitive way to success. Although I know they put in hard work, I believe there are many people who put in the work but things just do not work out for them. Once you sell a startup for a big valuation, you can basically spend the rest of your life talking about how you did it. While I respect those people for taking the bet, I think there is something irreproducible about startups that makes the whole narrative a bit skewed.</p> <p>One thing that stuck with me was the sentence: <em>“If you want an interesting life, start taking interesting decisions.”</em> Those decisions might not be the most obvious or easy ones; they might be the unlikely ones. They are indeed about rolling the dice. You have to roll the dice to roll a six—without it, there are no sixes in life. And if one good roll is what it takes to be able to brag for the rest of your life, you might just as well roll.</p> <h3 id="zurich-vs-san-francisco">Zurich vs. San Francisco</h3> <p>One final factual note: the feeling I have about startups from San Francisco is that they mostly focus on disruptive technology that can change how we live and reach billion-dollar valuations. What I have seen in the startup ecosystem around Zurich is that because Switzerland is a technologically advanced but quite conservative nation with a small market, most startups that get traction here are those with specific (mostly technological) Intellectual Property (IP).</p> <p>Folks here are not always open to the quick adoption of disruptive services (look around—there are still working phone boxes installed on the streets of Zurich). The market is also too small for that, so startups like that often have to move to the US anyway. Startups from Switzerland need a strong technological advantage over their competitors to survive. I do not think this is a hurdle—today you can expand internationally and adapt—but it is a factor to keep in mind when listening to people from San Francisco.</p> <p>Okay, now back to studying. Have a nice day. Love you!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="opinions"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maybe it is true, maybe not, but they sell it well.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Michaldeutsch</title><link href="https://michaltesnar.github.io/blog/2026/michaldeutsch/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Michaldeutsch"/><published>2026-01-25T14:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2026-01-25T14:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://michaltesnar.github.io/blog/2026/michaldeutsch</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://michaltesnar.github.io/blog/2026/michaldeutsch/"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>today is Monday, I was enjoying the weekend, so had no time to write a blog. Sidenote: last two weeks I was working on my ‘Bookshelf’ and ‘Projects’ folder, rather than this blog. Sorry for this ;)</p> <p>What? Michal enjoying the weekend? Yeah, so it happens, I am slowed down a bit this semester, and even though it is exam season I am trying not be completely die and have a life in between a little bit. Strange, also getting used to it. At the same time I am kinda worried that I have underestimated the exam, so the last few days will be intense that is for sure.</p> <p>The story that I wanted to tell today comes from Saturday. My lovely friend Max and I we were practicing our Swiss German together. It is our shared hobby, and as neither of us is Swiss we at least have the courage to speak with one another, and that is good. I try my best to consume as much content as possible, but poor Max, poor Max, he only learns from me. And we were in a supermarket, and a friend of mine (who is Swiss) heard Max talking in Swiss German. And he thought: “That sounds like Michal.” That is weird. So he went to investigate and indeed, not too far he also found me!</p> <p>I laugh my ass off telling this story. The thing is, I also picked up my accent from Loris Zimmerli, a swiss influencer. And he (on purpuse) speaks in a very funny accent, so that he can entertain people. So that is how Michal German, oder Michaldeutsch came to be. Learn it, it is very funny!</p> <p>Have a nice day! Keep doing what you are doing, you do it great!</p> <p>Michal</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="weekly-blog"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you (accidently) start your own dialect.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">New year!</title><link href="https://michaltesnar.github.io/blog/2026/new-year/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New year!"/><published>2026-01-03T14:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2026-01-03T14:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://michaltesnar.github.io/blog/2026/new-year</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://michaltesnar.github.io/blog/2026/new-year/"><![CDATA[<p>The new year is starting and I am still thinking about what I want 2026 to be like and what I can do about it: I do not know much yet, but there is a couple things to focus on and to finish (especially related to my studies), and I set some resolutions too. But maybe that is not a smart way to think abou, I want to be more open about what the life can bring and embrace that, so I will just try to keep my eyes and options open :)</p> <p>Today in the morning I was woke up thinking about the verb “to download”, so I wanted to share that. While in Dutch and German this word is more or less directly translated: “downloaden” and “herunterladen”. In Czech, we use “stahovat” which would more literaly translate to “pull down”. The French the word is “télécharger”, where “charger” also means to “charge”, like to “charge a phone”, where “télé” would refer to being done from a distance. Similarly in Spanish, where the verb “descargar” would mean be closer to the meaning of “charge”, but the prefix “des” would indicate more like undoing something. It is interesting, because it made me think about how we adapt technology and what words we use for it. Few decades ago, there was no downloading of files, cause there was no (widely available) internet.</p> <p>I guess at this point in time I lack a conclusion on this thought, but I still thought I would share it. I guess same goes for 2026: no clue where it will lead me, but I am ready to share it too!</p> <p>Happy new year! Best of luck with all that you will do :)</p> <p>Michal</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="weekly-blog"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[What will it bring?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Vánoce Vánoce přicházejí!</title><link href="https://michaltesnar.github.io/blog/2025/vanoce-prichazeji/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Vánoce Vánoce přicházejí!"/><published>2025-12-13T14:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-12-13T14:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://michaltesnar.github.io/blog/2025/vanoce-prichazeji</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://michaltesnar.github.io/blog/2025/vanoce-prichazeji/"><![CDATA[<p>Ho ho ho, it is Sunday, and you already know what it means: time for my weekly therapy. I write my blog and empty here my thoughts about what is bothering me. I write this in VSCode, which is where I spend most of my time anyway these days, so it kind of feels like I am productive anyway.</p> <p>I wrote the title of the blog in Czech, but just because I felt like it. This is how I roll these days with languages—I just use the words that come first. For example, I cannot call the chopped tomatoes I get in the supermarket anything else than “tomatoblokjes,” because that is how they call them in the Netherlands. There are a couple of words in my vocabulary that are German. And Christmas will always be Vánoce, because that is how it has always been back at home.</p> <p>Yes, home! It is the time of the year when I get to go back there. Since 2021, I have joined this special club called “the expats.” How do you spot one? They are flying back home for Christmas, and all their friends do too. Some people from further away stay behind, but in the expat community this will never feel like home one can come back to.</p> <p>I was usually never eager to go back home. But coming back to Czechia lately, I have realized how much I have missed from the lives of other people that I left behind. I was silently just typing my blog from afar, but I have done too little visiting and have been visited way too little. Creating this blog has been therapy for that, for sure, but I am trying to catch up more. I book tickets for someone’s birthday, making sure that I see my family when I am back. I love what I do, but I was surely isolating myself from others and overweighting work too much. I want to be included in the lives of people around me, and for that I have to be there physically. Christmas is just the time for that. I am taking some time off in Czechia before returning to the pits of despair before exams.</p> <p>That is the plan, and I am looking forward.</p> <p>See you all soon, and if not, then after New Year’s. Merry Christmas!</p> <p>Michal</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="weekly-blog"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time to go home.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Jungfraujoch</title><link href="https://michaltesnar.github.io/blog/2025/jungfraujoch/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Jungfraujoch"/><published>2025-12-06T14:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-12-06T14:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://michaltesnar.github.io/blog/2025/jungfraujoch</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://michaltesnar.github.io/blog/2025/jungfraujoch/"><![CDATA[<p>Sunday it is again!</p> <p>It is also the time of the year now: Christmas are just around the corner! This means the semester is ending, I have to plan my travels home and try get some gifts for the my dear ones. Fitting this all together with all deadlines and social events seems to be impossible. My now it seems like I have succesfully mastered the craft of constantly losing my mind in situations like this, I take a deep breath, ask the good lord for some peace in my soul and go on. Today I thought I would not let my thoughts drown me and I would still go and write my blog.</p> <p>I have a nice thing to share, this semester I have taken the Applied Glaciology course, where I learned a lot about how glaciers do what they do. They actually do quite a lot of things, on top of the mountain the temperatures are low so the precipitation solidifies into new ice. At the bottom of the glacier the temperatures are usually high, this means that the glacier is melting. The most interesting thing in my opinion happens in between, the glacier is moving! Ice is not fixed, through the pressure created by itself pushing from the top it moves down the mountain! I recommend watching videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWGR6FxFlt8">this one</a> to get the feelings of what is happening.</p> <p>As a part of this course, we have gone up to Jungfraujoch for an excursion. On the way there, we have seen a small avalanche from a glacier that has torn off!</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog/jungfraujoch-avalanche-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog/jungfraujoch-avalanche-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog/jungfraujoch-avalanche-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog/jungfraujoch-avalanche.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="500" height="300" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>On the top we have enjoyed the views, and relaxed for a bit!</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog/jungfraujoch-group-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog/jungfraujoch-group-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog/jungfraujoch-group-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog/jungfraujoch-group.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="500" height="300" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>And we fed the birds that go all the way up there, just to be fed by the tourists.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog/jungfraujoch-birds-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog/jungfraujoch-birds-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog/jungfraujoch-birds-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog/jungfraujoch-birds.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="500" height="300" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>It was quite impressive to be up in 3500+ meters.

It is the time of the week when the church bells go crazy in stark contrast to the empty and quiet streets. I decided to start writing my blog in English this week, though I had sketched it out first in Czech, because I thought I should make it more generally accessible. Now I know that Google Translate integration in browsers has my back, which is amazing because that means that this time I do not have to write with a specific audience in mind.</p> <p>I am slowly burning through the time given to me to complete the third semester of my master studies. It would not be the first time I am getting sentimental too early. I remember when I was about to graduate high school, I was contemplating since September the fact that one day I would not be doing my 8:00-15:00 at the same building as always. Sounded crazy to me. Though the life at uni is different, it seems that we have crossed the half-life of our cohort and that many people are already thinking of leaving.</p> <p>And that is great, but I have to admit that for me it is also hard. I find it hard to call a new place home, but it seems that as soon as I do it is time to move on. I remember saying goodbye to Groningen, but being ready to move on. But what I was kind of hoping is that the new destination could be home. What was also pulling me to Zurich was the upward mobility. And anybody who visits me here is stunned: in the heart of Europe, but still so much more rich than anywhere else. It is hard not to be charmed.</p> <p>But that absolutely means that a lot of people come here for the charm, make it a link in the chain of their career, rather than a part of their life. Same as in Groningen, the number of people who actually want to be integrated is quite low, and I have to say that makes me quite sad. Somehow relationships from the start seem somewhat shallow. That would totally be a fault of my own as well. Having a long-distance relationship, I do spend most of my evenings talking online on the phone, and when I get a long weekend off the last place where you can meet me before I fly off is the airport. So it absolutely goes both ways.</p> <p>What makes me sad is that this is not how I imagined my life. I hope that at one point I could find maybe a community of people, where I could stay and I could see a future in. It is only myself who I could blame for this emotion, but it seems that this is rather individual for everyone. If I want to fit in to the community that I am in right now, I should be jumping on the first opportunity of getting out of here to chase something else.</p> <p>I just realize that I have managed to leave Brno, and I have managed without thinking to leave Groningen. However, now I am thinking, where is the next place I will leave for? And why? What for?</p> <p>Lately, I have been listening to the song called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_hXGZ8NXAA">Dreamland</a> by Fox Stevenson. It goes like this:</p> <blockquote> <p>Does everybody live in a dreamland?</p> <p>Is this dreamland all that we know?</p> <p>Swallowing us up in an avalanche and blurring these lines with smoke</p> </blockquote> <p>Maybe Zurich just as well could be the dreamland. Too good to be true. Everybody’s dream, but nobody’s true life.</p> <p>I always like to say that I turn dreams into reality, but maybe what is missing right now is the ability to turn reality into home. Maybe it has to do with how I would pride myself on achievements. Well, Fox Stevenson has it for me.</p> <blockquote> <p>They tell me that I should be a real man</p> <p>But my pride’ll be the first thing to go</p> <p>I gotta get out of this wasteland</p> <p>Cause this wasteland ain’t home</p> </blockquote>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="weekly-blog"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does everybody live in a dreamland?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Nové životní problémy</title><link href="https://michaltesnar.github.io/blog/2025/job-market/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Nové životní problémy"/><published>2025-11-08T14:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-11-08T14:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://michaltesnar.github.io/blog/2025/job-market</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://michaltesnar.github.io/blog/2025/job-market/"><![CDATA[<p>Je nedělní ráno v Curychu. To se pozná podle dvou věcí. Zaprvé je venku mrtvo, protože všechno je v neděli zavřené. Všichni vyspávají, nebo vaří nedělní obědy a chystají se do kostela. Za druhé, momentálně je 9:45, kostely zvoní o sto šest (teď jsem strávil 5 minut hledáním na internetu, co to znamená o sto šest, proč to říkáme; neví se to, ale zdá se, že se někdo vsadil, že někdo něco nezvládne za 106 dní, nebo to vzniklo z rčení “být s to”). Já jsem si včera hodil celý den volno, nic jsem nedělal, a tak se teď sbírám a řeším, co vlastně tento týden budu dělat a jak to budu dělat, hezky si to všechno plánuju. Součástí plánování je vyčistit si mozek od toho, co se událo, co mě trápí a co mi dělá radost, a tak píšu. Jak jsem někde slyšel (prý od Joan Didion): “Nevěděl jsem, co si myslím, než jsem to začal psát.”</p> <p>Zjistil jsem, že se mi v životě opakuje jeden takový vzorec, tak jsem se o tom chtěl zmínit. Já si totiž vždycky myslím, že až skončí jedna fáze, tak že už budu mít hotovo a nebudu se muset dál snažit. Uvažme tento příklad: Michálek, kterému bylo 16 let, byl na střední a pěkně ho štval dějepis. Ten si říkal: “Tak už jen teď zatnu zuby a za rok mám hotovo, a pak už se nikdy dějepis učit nebudu, budu mít čas dělat to, co mě zajímá.” No jo, pak jsem si řekl, tak jo, jdeme teda studovat umělou inteligenci, tak to už máme v názvu, že děláme to, co nás zajímá (reálně moje úvaha tehdy byla, že nemám čas dělat to, co mě zajímá, tak bych se tomu měl věnovat přímo a ne jít studovat třeba matematiku). No, tak prvák měl jako předměty lineární algebru a diferenciální počet, tak se ale musím věnovat těm – nemám čas zajímat se o to, co se opravdu děje v umělé inteligenci. Vždyť to studuju, tak se to snad dozvím, jednou mi to snad někdo řekne. Budu se tomu věnovat, až budu mít hotovo.</p> <p>Jak sami asi vidíte, tento přístup má několik problémů.</p> <ol> <li>Realita, že na nic nemám čas a musím se věnovat čistě povinnostem, není pravdivá. Zvlášť ne na střední škole. Povinnosti v tu chvíli jsou minimální, a když už v tu chvíli jsem cítil, že nemám mentální kapacitu ani číst knížky, co mě baví, protože beru svoje povinnosti moc vážně, tak bylo asi něco špatně.</li> <li>Oddaloval jsem věci, které mě opravdu zajímaly. Raději jsem se učil stupidní dějepis, než abych četl o tom, co mě opravdu zajímá. Neříkám, že dějepis nebyl nezajímavý, byl a je. Ale nikdy to nebylo to, co dávalo mému životu smysl. Místo toho, abych hledal co mě opravdu zajímá, jsem studoval věci, za které mě někdo odměnil dobrou známkou. Žádný člověk, o kterém někdo slyší, že se naučil sám programování, nebo někam posunul technologie (e.g. Daniel Ek ze Spotify), se neučil programování, protože ho za to někdo známkoval. Učil se ho proto, že to bylo to, co chtěl dělat, když měl volno.</li> <li>Reálně jsem si vždycky myslel, že radost je v tom, nic nemuset. Nemuset do školy, nemuset do práce, nemuset nikam. Když se mě někdo zeptal, když jsem byl malý, čím bych chtěl být, tak jsem říkal, že rentiérem. A pak jsem byl mega šťastný, když jsem našel práci jako plavčík, kde jsem prakticky celou dobu nemusel nic dělat. Reálně, co mi ale vždycky dávalo energii od života, bylo snažení. Snažení něčeho dosáhnout, ve studiích, v brigádách, ve sportu. Ten moment, kdy se člověk soustředí, zatne zuby a jde dál, byl vždycky super. Práce, kde nic dělat nemusím, je k ničemu. A tak dělat teď něco, abych později nemusel, nedává moc smysl, protože později nebudu mít co dělat.</li> </ol> <p>Proč to tak řeším teď? Tak se pomalu blížím ke konci studia, to tak vypadá. Jejda, sakra, a co dál?! Konec velkého snažení…! Nebo ne…? Čeká mě nesnesitelná lehkost bytí? Vidím, jak se ostatní okolo mě ženou za svou první pracovní pozicí. A já si říkám, co mě čeká tam? Další moment, kdy nebudu mít čas se nadechnout, protože se budu bát jen abych se dobře znal 20 stránek firemního dějepisu? Nebo snad možná nějaká nová lineární algebra, která mi zase nedá spát a já nebudu číst žádnou zajímavou knížku?</p> <p>A tak na chvíli odkládám učebnice, je přece víkend. Píšu si blog. Našel jsem novou knížku o tom, jak funguje mozek, která je velmi zajímavá. Učím se hrát kulečník. Snažím se reálně si všimnout lidí okolo sebe. Poznat je a zeptat se jich, jak se jim daří. Snažím se přemýšlet, co mě motivuje a co bych opravdu po zbytek života chtěl dělat. Možná z toho nebude maturitní průměr 1,0, možná z toho nebude 800 metrů za 2 minuty. Možná z toho nebude publikovaný článek. Ale možná to bude dávat smysl víc než jenom do té doby, než se to odevzdalo, odeběhlo a publikovalo. A možná z toho na konci dne zůstane víc než stopa strachu v duši z toho, že neudělám zkoušku. Možná čtení té knížky je to, co se počítá. Jakou knížku člověk četl, a jestli o ní přemýšlel. A ne to, že ji člověk dočetl, zapsal do čtenářského deníku a odevzdal ve čtvrtek ráno 9:35 do kabinetu češtináře. To je totiž nakonec úplně všem fuk.</p> <p>Tak jo, mějte se hezky. A dělejte to, co vám dává smysl.</p> <p>Michi (prý to je jedna švýcarská verze)</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="weekly-blog"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jak jsem si myslel, že už mám pro jednou zase hotovo...]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Výlet do Mnichova</title><link href="https://michaltesnar.github.io/blog/2025/munich-trip/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Výlet do Mnichova"/><published>2025-11-01T14:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-11-01T14:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://michaltesnar.github.io/blog/2025/munich-trip</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://michaltesnar.github.io/blog/2025/munich-trip/"><![CDATA[<p>Dobrý den,</p> <p>je neděle ráno, já si sedím u svého laptopu, srkám čaj a přemýšlím, jak bude vypadat další týden. Hlavně je ale čas ohlédnout se za tím minulým. Nejdůležitějším zážitkem bylo, že jsem si na konci týdne vyrazil na výlet do Mnichova.</p> <p>Studuje tam bývalý spolužák z Groningenu, jmenuje se Sam. Kecali jsme o tom, jak se nám daří, o tom, jak jde život, zašli jsme do posilovny, Sam mi ukázal školu a centrum, a pak už jsem pádil zpět do Curychu.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog/sam-tum-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog/sam-tum-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog/sam-tum-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog/sam-tum.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="500" height="300" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Bylo hezké vidět po dlouhé době někoho, kdo mě zná, jaký jsem byl dřív. Je to dobrá sebereflexe. A je taky fajn vidět město z pohledu někoho, kdo ho zná, bydlí tam a má s ním spojené příběhy.</p> <p>Takže asi tak. A jede se dál.</p> <p>Už se těším na Vánoce.</p> <p>Mějte se hezky.</p> <p>Michal</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="weekly-blog"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Návštěva u bývalého spolužáka]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Polsko není tak daleko, jak by se člověku zdálo</title><link href="https://michaltesnar.github.io/blog/2025/polsko/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Polsko není tak daleko, jak by se člověku zdálo"/><published>2025-10-25T14:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-25T14:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://michaltesnar.github.io/blog/2025/polsko</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://michaltesnar.github.io/blog/2025/polsko/"><![CDATA[<p>Minulý týden jsem napsal blog, ale zapomněl jsem ho zveřejnit. Tak ho tu máte taky, ale s datem z minulosti. Je to trošku škoda, protože bych chtěl vysílat pravidelné signály o svém životě. Ale tak tento týden se toho tolik neudělo, a tak se necítím alespoň tak špatně, že jsem toho asi dnes tolik nenapíšu.</p> <p>Musím si se znova zmínit o tom, čeho jsem si už dříve všiml. Většinu času v zahraničí se snažím netrávit moc času s Čechy. Ne, že bych se jim vyhýbal, ale čistě to není mým cílem, snažím se raději trávit více času s lidmi jiných národností. No, a jak jste si možná všimli, často se tak stane, že mnoho z nich jsou Poláci.</p> <p>Včera jsem se náhodou v dostavil na jednu večerní polskou sešlost. Pilo se, tancovalo se, zpívalo se, a mluvilo se samozřejmě. Tak jsem si znova ověřil, že polštině se dá perfektně rozumět. A tak jsem si mluvil česky, oni polsky, a bylo nám fajn. A tak si říkám, že máme k Polsku mnohem blíž, než by si člověk na první pohled myslel. Vždycky jsme měl spojeno Česko a Slovensko, nikdy jsem sice sám v Českoslovenku nežil, ale historicky a kulturně mi to dávalo smysl. Ale Polsko pro mě bylo nějak dál. Naopak třeba Srbochorvatština spojuje národy přes hranice, i když je jiné spory rozdělily to různých států. Ale já k Polsku (možná si jen něco neuvědomuju) necítím žádný odpor, a tak se mi zdá, že ty rozdíly jsou menší, než všechno to, co máme společné.</p> <p>No takže tak.</p> <p>Tutaj wszystko jest dobre.</p> <p>Michal</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="weekly-blog"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kulturní schledání za hranicemi]]></summary></entry></feed>
